I'm an AI researcher seeking to understand how deep learning models work better.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding shortcut learning in small and large language models.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working on quantifying the performance of pure vision models to solve the [ARC-AGI challenge](https://arcprize.org/).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interpreting language models and how they perform arithmetic operations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mechanistic interpretability of language models.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coming up and proving theories about large language models.
