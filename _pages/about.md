I'm an applied AI researcher and practitioner trying to understand and improve the performance of deep learning models.

- 🔬 I’m currently working on understanding how information is stored and retrieved in discrete diffusion language models using ROME. Checkout 🔬 [discrete-diffusion-rome](https://github.com/raishish/discrete-diffusion-rome).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GPU programming (and re-learning C++) across different accelerator backends. Checkout 🚀 [unikernels](https://github.com/raishish/unikernels).
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I often contribute to open source and open science projects as well.
