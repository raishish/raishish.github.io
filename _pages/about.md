I'm an AI researcher and practitioner trying to understand and improve the performance of deep learning models.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using discrete diffusion models to solve the [ARC-AGI challenge](https://arcprize.org/).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working to gain a causal / mechanistic understanding of how discrete diffusion language models work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about diffusion models, applied to both continuous and discrete data.
